## Installation  
 
    npm install  



## Usage  
To get the most out of this repo, user should have an understanding of HTML, JavaScript and ES6, and NodeJS. Jest is used for testing and Inquirer is used for prompts. CSS is all Bootstrap and HTML templates and render functions were provided. I'm not crazy about these and would like to do further development in the future.  

To start application, run npm run:  
 
    npm run  
 



## Tests  

    npm test jest
